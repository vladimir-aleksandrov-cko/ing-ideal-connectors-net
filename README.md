## Checkout.com related notes

This is a spike to port [iDealAdvancedConnector](iDealAdvancedConnector) to .NET Standard 2.0. All the XML related classes compile, [](iDealAdvancedConnector/Connector.cs) needs some more attention. Most notably in the following areas.

- Configuration
- Certificate loading
- HTTP requests (we want to use HttpClient)
